Development Notes:

Todo:
- designs

- make it easier to work with beats/timing - renaming variables for clarity, figure out something that makes more sense.
    there should be functions to get timings, like an array of times when a sound should play based on a pattern, or if we want a metronome or sound to play every 1 beats or half beats etc.

- refactor grid snap calculation - make it a helper function (can also be used in playback)

Oscillator.vue
- on oscillator - if user clicks osc name + id, allow to give the osc a name
- should be able to expand + minimise instruments

In piano roll:
- 'onion skin' effect for scales - in notes

Drum machine tab - new tab or just bottom part of screen ( can be minimised )
- Implement swing - changing the timing by a % for certain beats
    probably this can be done by editing the sorted notes array;    

- Implement swing (modify notes array so if beats occur within certain ranges, they are snapped to different %s of each beat (subtracted from if is early, added to if is late)

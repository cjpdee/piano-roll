Development Notes:

Todo:
- designs

- make it possible to either lock or unlock the roll:
    lock would fix 24 or 12 notes & the length of the loop to the screen
    unlocked would be free movement, choose either x or y unlock or both

- reduce master volume to around 60%
- by running the output through a gain node
- possibly 1 for each oscillator as well as a master gain node
- although I think oscillators might have their own gain attribute

- make it easier to work with beats/timing - renaming variables for clarity, figure out something that makes more sense.
    there should be functions to get timings, like an array of times when a sound should play based on a pattern, or if we want a metronome or sound to play every 1 beats or half beats etc.

- refactor grid snap calculation - make it a helper function (can also be used in playback)

Oscillator.vue
- on oscillator - if user clicks osc name + id, allow to give the osc a name
- should be able to expand + minimise instruments
- or pop out to an extended view - using vertical range sliders

In piano roll:
- 'onion skin' effect for scales - in notes

Drum machine tab - new tab or just bottom part of screen ( can be minimised )

- Implement swing (modify notes array so if beats occur within certain ranges, they are snapped to different %s of each beat (negative from if is early, positive to if is late)

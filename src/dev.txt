Development Notes:

Todo:
- pressing alt should snap notes to grid when moving
- get resizing working + commits to store
- Need to define the end of playback and then do stuff (loop or stop, but always reset the position marker)

- lock / unlock piano roll

- make it easier to work with beats/timing - renaming variables for clarity, figure out something that makes more sense.
	there should be functions to get timings, like an array of times when a sound should play based on a pattern, or if we want a metronome or sound to play every 1 beats or half beats etc.

- refactor grid snap calculation - make it a helper function (can also be used in playback)

Oscillator.vue
- on oscillator - if user clicks osc name + id, allow to give the osc a name
- should be able to expand + minimise instruments
- or pop out to an extended view - using vertical range sliders

- The range of filters should be computed - rather than most of the slider making no audible difference
	( at the moment, only 5-10% of the slider makes any difference )

In piano roll:
- 'onion skin' effect for scales - in notes

Drum machine tab - new tab or just bottom part of screen ( can be minimised )

- Implement swing (modify notes array so if beats occur within certain ranges, they are snapped to different %s of each beat (negative from if is early, positive to if is late)

- Create a system wherein routing can be better managed - ideally the user should not have any input to routing
- Each source might have a filter or several and then a 'wet' and a 'dry' channel
- Oscillators can have a number of filters / shapers and perhaps this can be reordered
- Eventually want to attach attack / decay which will need to be visually modelled properly
- Then a function connects the oscillators to each filter in order, then to the wet/ dry, then to master
- The wet and dry channels should have their own gain controls - or a simple slider between the two

- Then perhaps output to a dynamics compressor

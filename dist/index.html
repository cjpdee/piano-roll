            app notes

            include the main shell of the app in a style tag once it's finished
            preload the css files alongside this and use it when the user
            starts to interact with the page
            this should reduce rendering time a bit

            keep shallow dom tree to mitigate impact of reflows

            use absolute positioning in the piano roll to prevent reflows


            use 1-8 keys to choose note lengths
